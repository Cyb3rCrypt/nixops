Installation
============

NixOps runs on Linux and Mac OS X. (It may also run on other platforms;
the main prerequisite is that Nix runs on your platform.) Installing it
requires the following steps:

1. Install the Nix package manager. Itâ€™s available from the `Nix
   website <http://nixos.org/nix/download.html>`__ in binary form for
   several platforms. Please refer to the `installation
   instruction <http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-installation>`__ in
   the Nix manual for more details.

2. Install the latest version of NixOps.

      $ nix-env -i nixops
