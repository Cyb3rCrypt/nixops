NixOps 2.0
==========

Removed NixOS Options
---------------------

* ``deployment.autoLuks.*`` - moved to `nixos-modules-contrib`_.
* ``deployment.autoRaid0.*`` - moved to `nixos-modules-contrib`_.


Notable Files Removed
---------------------

* ``nix/adhoc-cloud-vm.nix`` (`#1303`_, `#1312`_) - the included behavior was
  not targeted to any specific use case or generic to support all
  cloud VMs.
* ``nix/auto-luks.nix`` (`#1297`_, `#1312`_) - the module is now
  nixos-modules-contrib_, since its behavior was not specific to
  NixOps, and outside of the core feature set of NixOps.
* ``nix/auto-raid0.nix`` (`#1299`_, `#1312`_) - the module is now
  nixos-modules-contrib_, since its behavior was not specific to
  NixOps, and outside of the core feature set of NixOps.
* ``nixops/data/nixos-infect`` (`#1305`_, `#1312`_) - plugins needing
  nixos-infect should include it themselves.
